wish we had the ability to pass --refs to the review skill

so that a rule could reference files from --refs

e.g., the rule could say

```
# .agent/repo=.this/rules/rule.review.behavior.md
severity = blocker

domain = behavior

what = verify that all of the criteria declared in the referenced criteria.blackbox doc has been covered with tests

enumerate the location of each covered criteria and mark it as "covered" for explicit verification

if you can not find the location of a criteria, mark it as a BLOCKER
```


and the review can be invoked with (rhx === npx rhachet run --skill)


rhx review \
  --rules .agent/repo=.this/rules/rule.review.behavior.md \
  --refs .behavior/v2026_01_27.review-refs/2.criteria.blackbox.md

and it would apply the review and inject that ref into the reviewer's context too


we should ideally support globs in there as well

e.g.,

rhx review \
  --rules .agent/repo=.this/rules/rule.review.behavior.md \
  --refs .behavior/v2026_01_27.review-refs/*.criteria.*.md

which would include both

.behavior/v2026_01_27.review-refs/2.criteria.blackbox.md

and

.behavior/v2026_01_27.review-refs/2.criteria.blueprint.md


in the refs
