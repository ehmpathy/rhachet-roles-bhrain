is it possible to run claude-code in interactive mode and still generate one json result at
 the end after interactive exit? as if it was non interactive?

=> would be great for diagnostics

is it better to inject context of rules + diffs + paths ? or better to have claude auto explore? when? why

assumption = if the input prompt is close to limit, claude will do a bad job? or will autocompact and loose info?

is that right? what are the benchmarks on ideal context window usage for non-interactive claude-code invocation?
