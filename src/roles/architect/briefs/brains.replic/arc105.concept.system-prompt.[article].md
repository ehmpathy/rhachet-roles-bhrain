# system-prompt

## .what

the initial instructions provided to an llm at the start of a conversation that define its behavior, capabilities, constraints, and persona.

## .why

the system prompt is the primary mechanism for shaping a replic brain's behavior. it establishes what tools are available, how to use them, what style to adopt, and what constraints to follow. changes to the system prompt fundamentally alter the agent's capabilities.

## dependsOn

- `llm` — interprets and follows the system prompt
- `context-window` — system prompt consumes context tokens

## key characteristics

- **persistent**: remains in context for entire conversation
- **privileged**: typically cannot be overridden by user messages
- **declarative**: describes desired behavior, not code
- **composable**: can include tool definitions, examples, constraints

## typical contents (replic brains)

```
- persona/role definition
- available tools and their schemas
- behavioral constraints
- output format requirements
- examples of desired behavior
- safety guardrails
```

## examples

| system | system prompt size | notable elements |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| claude code | ~15k tokens | tool definitions, coding guidelines, git workflow |
| codex | varies | sandbox rules, security constraints |
