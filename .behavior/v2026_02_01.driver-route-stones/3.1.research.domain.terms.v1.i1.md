# research: domain terms v1

## domain objects identified

from the wish, vision, and criteria, we need terms for:

1. **the path itself** — the sequence of steps to follow
2. **the markers along the path** — checkpoints/milestones to achieve
3. **the gatekeepers** — what validates pass/fail at certain markers
4. **the evaluators** — what decides pass/fail
5. **the traveler** — who/what navigates the path

## parallel concepts from other domains

### bluecollar: roman roads

the romans invented the milestone — literally a stone marker placed every 1,000 paces (*milia passuum*) along roads [1].

> "The Romans erected stone markers at mile intervals to notify travelers of distances covered or remaining. These markers were conveniently called milestones." [1]

> "A miliarium was a cylindrical, oval, or parallelepiped column placed on the edge of Roman roads to mark distances every thousand passus" [2]

> "Augustus, after becoming permanent commissioner of roads in 20 BC, set up the miliarium aureum ('golden milestone') near the Temple of Saturn. All roads were considered to begin from this gilded bronze monument." [2]

the term "milestone" was first coined in 1746 but the practice predates it by millennia [3].

### bluecollar: trails and cairns

a **waypoint** is "a point or place on a route or line of travel, a stopping point, an intermediate point, or point at which course is changed" — first used in 1880 [4].

> "Waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features of the real world, such as rock formations, springs, oases, mountains, buildings, roadways, waterways" [4]

a **cairn** is a human-made pile of stones used as trail markers — predates written history.

### project management: stage gates

the **stage gate** process divides projects into stages separated by decision gates [5].

> "The term 'Gate' was introduced by co-founder Dr. Robert G. Cooper when he coined the term Stage-Gate to mark the introduction of this novel approach" [5]

> "The gates control the process and serve as quality control and checkpoints for 'Go', 'Kill', 'Hold' and 'Modify' decisions" [5]

**quality gates** represent "a checkpoint of predefined criteria set by the project manager to evaluate the current progress" [6].

**inch pebbles** are status review checkpoints prior to a milestone date — "the premise is one of short-interval scheduling" [7].

### healthcare: care pathways

a **clinical pathway** (also care pathway, care map, patient journey) is "the step-by-step movement of patients through the healthcare system" [8].

> "A care pathway is longer and includes outpatient department's activities, discharge from the hospital and after-care" [8]

> "The most usual form of presentation used for clinical pathways is a temporal matrix, with divisions for days and hours of the day, in which all events and interventions are carefully distributed" [9]

### culinary: mise en place

**mise en place** (French: "put in place") is the setup required before execution [10].

> "Mise en place is such a vital aspect of learning to cook professionally that it's one of the first lessons taught in culinary schools" [10]

> "Near the middle of the 19th century, Auguste Escoffier... used his experience with strict military systems and clear rules to develop the mise en place system" [10]

the structure: read → prioritize → collect tools → gather ingredients → prepare → set up workstation [10].

### judicial: judge and arbiter

**judge** (c. 1200) from Latin *iudicare* — compound of *ius* "right, law" + *dicere* "to say" [11].

> "By mid-14c., 'judge' referred to a 'public officer appointed to administer the law,' and extended from late 14c. to persons who decide any sort of contest" [11]

**arbiter** (late 14c.) from Latin meaning "one who attends something to view it as a spectator or witness" — by extension, "any person given absolute power to judge and rule on a matter in dispute" [12].

> "The decision of an arbiter is made according to the rules of law and equity" [12]

### navigation: route

**route** (c. 1200) from Latin *rupta (via)* meaning "(a road) opened by force" [13].

> "The Romans had a phrase for a certain type of path that could be relied upon: a via rupta, a 'broken way'. The way wasn't broken in the sense of being dysfunctional—rather, the road had been broken through a mountain, a forest, a thicket" [13]

### idiom: stepping stone

**stepping stone** — earliest evidence from c. 1325, originally "a foot-stool" then "raised stone in a stream or wet place to preserve the shoes in crossing" [14].

> "The figurative sense emerged by 1650s" [14]

> Tennyson (1850): "men may rise on stepping-stones / Of their dead selves to higher things" [14]

## term analysis

### the path itself

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **route** | latin *rupta* "broken through" | cleared path, reliable way | strong — implies intentional creation |
| path | old english | generic, any track | weak — too generic |
| trail | old french *trailler* | left behind, drag marks | weak — implies discovery not design |
| journey | old french *journée* | day's travel | weak — emphasizes travel not structure |
| itinerary | latin *iter* "journey" | planned list of places | medium — implies plan but not structure |
| pathway | compound | clinical/healthcare feel | medium — used in healthcare domain |

**recommendation**: **route** — it implies intentional design ("broken through"), is the root of "routine", and fits the metaphor of a cleared path that can be relied upon.

### the markers along the path

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **stone** | old english *stān* | physical marker, permanence | strong — connects to milestone, stepping-stone |
| milestone | roman milia + stone | significant marker | medium — implies significance, maybe too heavy |
| waypoint | way + point | navigation coordinate | medium — modern, GPS feel |
| checkpoint | check + point | verification stop | medium — implies verification |
| stage | latin *stare* "stand" | theater, platforms | weak — too theatrical |
| step | old english | action, not marker | weak — verb feel |

**recommendation**: **stone** — short, ancient, connects to "milestone" and "stepping-stone" idioms. a stone is a marker you pass. "route stones" or just "stones" on a route.

### the gatekeepers

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **guard** | old french *guarder* | protect, watch over | strong — protects quality, watches passage |
| gate | old english *geat* | entry point | medium — the structure, not the keeper |
| checkpoint | check + point | verification | weak — the place, not the mechanism |
| barrier | old french | obstacle | weak — negative connotation |

**recommendation**: **guard** — implies protection and watchfulness. a guard at a stone decides who passes.

### the evaluators

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **judge** | latin *iudicare* | decide per law | strong — authoritative, final decision |
| arbiter | latin "one who witnesses" | impartial decider | medium — less common |
| reviewer | re + view | examines again | medium — implies examination not decision |
| assessor | latin *assessor* | assistant to judge | weak — subordinate feel |
| grader | grade + -er | assigns score | weak — educational feel |

**recommendation**: **judge** — universally understood as the decision maker. judges emit verdicts.

### the evaluations

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **review** | re + view | examination | strong — thorough look, feedback |
| assessment | latin *assidere* | sit beside, evaluate | medium — formal |
| inspection | latin *inspicere* | look into | medium — quality control feel |
| audit | latin *audire* "hear" | formal finance | weak — financial connotation |

**recommendation**: **review** — implies feedback, examination, and is commonly understood.

### the traveler

| candidate | origin | connotation | fit |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **driver** | drive + -er | one who drives | strong — active, in control |
| navigator | latin *navigare* | one who steers | medium — implies direction |
| traveler | travel + -er | one who travels | weak — passive |
| runner | run + -er | one who runs | weak — implies speed |

**recommendation**: **driver** — implies agency, control, and active progression. the driver navigates the route.

## term relationships

- a **route** contains ordered **stones**
- each **stone** may have a **guard**
- a **guard** specifies **reviews** and **judges**
- **reviews** produce feedback files
- **judges** produce verdict files (pass/fail)
- a **driver** navigates the route, stone by stone

---

## ubiquitous language proposal

| term | definition |
|------|------------|
| **route** | an ordered sequence of stones that guides a brain toward an objective |
| **stone** | a marker on a route that must be passed to progress |
| **guard** | a gatekeeper at a stone that validates passage via reviews and judges |
| **review** | an examination that produces feedback about artifact quality |
| **judge** | an evaluator that decides pass/fail based on criteria |
| **driver** | the role that navigates routes, passes stones, and responds to guards |
