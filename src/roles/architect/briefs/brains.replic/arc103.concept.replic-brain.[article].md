# replic-brain

## .what

an llm operating behind a repl interface, forming an interactive system capable of iterative reasoning, tool use, and task completion through conversation.

## .why

the term "replic brain" names the specific architectural pattern where an llm's capabilities are harnessed through a read-eval-print-loop. this pattern enables the llm to act as an agent — receiving feedback, taking actions, and iterating toward goals.

## dependsOn

- `llm` — provides reasoning and generation
- `repl` — provides interactive loop structure

## key characteristics

- **conversational**: maintains dialogue state across turns
- **tool-capable**: can invoke external tools and process results
- **iterative**: refines approach based on feedback
- **goal-directed**: works toward completing user tasks
