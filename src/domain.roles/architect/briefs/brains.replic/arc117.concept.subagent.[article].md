# subagent

## .what

a child agent spawned by a parent agent, operating with its own isolated context window to perform a delegated subtask before returning results.

## .why

subagents address two key challenges: context exhaustion and task parallelization. by delegating subtasks to agents with fresh context windows, the parent can tackle larger problems without filling its own context. subagents can also run in parallel for independent tasks.

## dependsOn

- `agentic-loop` — both parent and child run loops
- `context-window` — isolation is the key benefit
- `tool-definition` — subagent spawning is a tool

## pattern

```
Parent Agent (main context)
    │
    ├── Task tool: "explore codebase for auth patterns"
    │       │
    │       └── Subagent (fresh context)
    │               ├── Glob, Grep, Read...
    │               └── Returns summary
    │
    └── Continues with summary in context
```

## key characteristics

- **isolated context**: subagent starts fresh
- **focused task**: single delegated objective
- **returns results**: output injected into parent context
- **may be typed**: different subagent types for different tasks

## subagent types (claude code)

| type | purpose | tools available |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Explore | codebase exploration | Glob, Grep, Read |
| Plan | implementation planning | Read, planning tools |
| general-purpose | complex multi-step tasks | all tools |

## parallelization

subagents enable parallel execution:
```
Parent: "search for auth and search for database patterns"
    │
    ├── Subagent A: auth exploration ──────┐
    │                                      ├── (parallel)
    └── Subagent B: database exploration ──┘
    │
    └── Combine results
```

## tradeoffs

| benefit | cost |
|---------|------|
| context isolation | summarization loss when returning |
| parallelization | coordination complexity |
| fresh start | loses parent context unless passed |
| focused execution | additional API calls |
