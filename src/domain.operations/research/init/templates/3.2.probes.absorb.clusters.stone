read all kernel files in $RESEARCH_DIR_REL/kernel/

## instructions

catalogize the kernels:
- cluster by domain
- relate kernels to each other (dependencies, contradictions, reinforcements)
- blend converged kernels into representative kernels that point to each citation

index based on treestruct hierarchy for lookup:
- most abstract concepts at root
- progressively concrete toward leaves
- cross-references via [$ref(kernel-NNN)] for related kernels

note: this may be a massive inventory of knowledge kernels; do this process incrementally and evolve the treestruct if needed; every single kernel must be accounted for

note: do not pigeonhole kernels into extant clusters if they fundamentally signal a new cluster; these are valuable signals that inform us of gaps in our exploration, via symmetry or inherent questions
