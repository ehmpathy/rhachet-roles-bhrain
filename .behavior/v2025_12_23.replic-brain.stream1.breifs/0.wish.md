wish =

given this definition of brains; src/roles/thinker/briefs/term=brain.atomic_vs_replic.md

we wish to

1. thoroughly udnerstand how the replic brain of `claude-code` works
   1. cite sources
   2. cite papers
   3. breakdown atomic fundamental concepts
   4. show the treestruct of how they build upon eachother
   5. output a blueprint of exactly how its built

2. declare that breakdown in src/roles/architect/briefs
   1. specifically, create a new role called architect (i.e., bhrain architect)
   2. i.e., `src/roles/architect/briefs/brains.replic`
   3. just like the other breifs in this repo are structure, specifically the `src/roles/thinker/briefs/` operate, in terms of campus course breifs of articles, demos, and catalogs
   4. this role's briefs should explain exactly how brains are constructed and architected
   5. thsi role should be expected to keep up with the latest research on brain architectures that lead to the best artificial brains. (today, llm based, like `brain=replic:anthropic:claude-code`)
   6. the briefs should include a pseudocode blueprint for exactly how the claude code brain works, in addition to other notable replic brain architectures

---

the output of the wish = the breifs

wish = produce this output

---

note: the breifs should conform to the patterns established in src/roles/thinker/briefs/knowledge

unless theres a strong reason not to


---

atleast two different brain structures should be blueprinted at the end. claude-code and atleast one alternative replic brain structure


---

should include an exhaustive search of todays literature and a catalog of all of the research cited
