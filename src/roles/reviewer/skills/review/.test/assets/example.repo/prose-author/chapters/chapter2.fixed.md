# chapter 2: the reef garden

shelly loved to explore the coral garden more than all else.
the anemones danced in the current, and she never tired of the view.

"these corals glow unlike all else," marco whispered. sunlight shimmered
through the water and made all look magical.

shelly swam through the arches with joy. she discovered hidden caves
and met new fish friends on the way.

a sea star waved from below. creatures greeted each other with pure warmth.
shelly belonged here — she connected with the reef in a way words could not capture.

"to live here is the dream," marco said. they drifted among the corals,
breathed the salty water, and became one with the ocean.

a school of tangs glittered past them. they moved together in perfect harmony,
a reminder of why shelly and marco loved this place so much.
