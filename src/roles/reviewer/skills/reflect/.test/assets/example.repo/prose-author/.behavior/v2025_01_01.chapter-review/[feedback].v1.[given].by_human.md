# feedback on chapter 3 draft

## context

reviewing chapter 3 "the art of simplicity" for the writing guide

## observations

### sentence structure

several sentences start with gerunds which creates a monotonous rhythm:

```
Walking through the forest, she noticed the birds.
Running across the field, he felt free.
Thinking about tomorrow, they made plans.
```

prefer varied sentence structures:

```
She walked through the forest and noticed the birds.
He ran across the field, feeling free.
As they thought about tomorrow, they made plans.
```

### passive voice

excessive passive voice makes prose feel distant:

```
The decision was made by the committee.
The book was written by an unknown author.
```

prefer active voice:

```
The committee made the decision.
An unknown author wrote the book.
```

## summary

focus on sentence variety and active voice to improve readability.
