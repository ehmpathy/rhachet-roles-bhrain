# rules

## .what

rules are materialized feedback patterns that encode best practices and quality standards for a domain.

each rule represents a generalized insight extracted from real feedback - a distillation of lessons learned from actual experience.

## .why

rules enable consistent quality by making implicit knowledge explicit:

- capture hard-won lessons from feedback cycles
- prevent repeat mistakes across team members and projects
- provide a shared vocabulary for discussing quality
- enable automated review and validation

## .how rules relate to practices

practices organize rules by domain concern. each practice directory contains rules that apply to that domain. rules within the same practice share context and may reference each other.

the specific practice domains vary by project and role - there is no prescribed set of practices.

## .how rules materialize from feedback

feedback flows through a reflection process to become rules:

1. **feedback occurs** - human provides guidance on specific artifact
2. **pattern emerges** - similar feedback repeats across contexts
3. **rule crystallizes** - generalized rule extracted from pattern
4. **citation traces** - each rule links back to origin feedback

this materialization process ensures rules are grounded in real needs, not imagined requirements.

## .note

rules are living documents. as new feedback emerges, rules may be:
- refined (clarify edge cases)
- updated (incorporate new insights)
- deprecated (superseded by better understanding)
- split (single rule becomes multiple specific rules)
