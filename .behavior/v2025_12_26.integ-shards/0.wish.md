we want to use integration test matrixes within .test.yml

to support faster integration tests while still using the free github actions runners for public repos

how can we satisfy both requirements:
1. we have explicitly declared shards; allowlists of files per
shards
2. the REST go into dynamicly computed shards; given the number of
shards left, let jest decide the rest


for example


jest.integration.shards.jsonc =

```jsonc
{
  // run the super slow ones on their own shards; they'll pretty much own the wall time
  "explicit": [
    {
      "patterns": ["src/roles/reviewer/skills/reflect/reflect.casePriorRules.integration.test.ts"]
    },
    {
      "patterns": ["src/roles/reviewer/skills/reflect/reflect.caseTypescriptQuality.integration.test.ts"]
    },
  ],
  // the rest can by dnamically allocated across 3 shards
  "dynamic": { "shards": 3 }
}
```
