# tool-definition

## .what

a schema that describes a tool's interface — its name, purpose, parameters, and expected behavior — enabling an llm to understand when and how to invoke it.

## .why

tool definitions are the contract between the llm and external capabilities. by providing structured schemas, the llm can reason about which tools apply to a task, what parameters to provide, and what results to expect. well-designed tool definitions are essential for reliable agent behavior.

## dependsOn

- `system-prompt` — tool definitions are typically included in system prompt
- `llm` — interprets tool definitions and decides when to invoke

## key characteristics

- **name**: unique identifier for the tool
- **description**: natural language explanation of purpose
- **parameters**: typed schema (often JSON Schema) for inputs
- **returns**: description of expected output format

## example schema

```json
{
  "name": "Read",
  "description": "Reads a file from the filesystem",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "file_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Absolute path to the file"
      },
      "offset": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "Line number to start reading from"
      }
    },
    "required": ["file_path"]
  }
}
```
