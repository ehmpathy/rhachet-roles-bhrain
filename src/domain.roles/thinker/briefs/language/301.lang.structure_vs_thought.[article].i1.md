# linguistic affordances with contrastive examples

---

## 1. implicit subjects & topic–comment structure

### claim
chinese frequently omits subjects once context is established; english resists this.

### source
Li, Charles N. & Thompson, Sandra A. — *Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar*
https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520066106/mandarin-chinese

> “Chinese is a topic-prominent language in which the topic need not be the grammatical subject, and subjects may be omitted when pragmatically recoverable.”

---

### examples

#### example 1a — constructed (state without agent)

**chinese**
\`\`\`
方案已经改了。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> the plan has already been changed.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> someone has already revised the plan.
> / we’ve already updated the plan.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese reports a **state change**
- english requires **agent reconstruction**

---

#### example 1b — discourse-natural (topic continuity)

**chinese**
\`\`\`
这个问题不大，已经处理好了。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> this problem isn’t serious; it’s already been handled.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> this issue isn’t serious; the team has already taken care of it.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese relies on discourse topic
- english reintroduces an actor

---

#### example 1c — research-attested

> “Once a topic is established, subsequent clauses may omit both subject and object, relying entirely on discourse context.”

**citation**
Li, C. N., & Thompson, S. A. (1981). *Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar*. UC Press.

**contrastive implication**
- chinese: reasoning proceeds via **topic persistence**
- english: reasoning proceeds via **agent chaining**

---

## 2. parataxis vs hypotaxis (implicit vs explicit causality)

### claim
chinese often implies causality through sequencing; english encodes it with markers.

### source
Halliday, M. A. K. — *An Introduction to Functional Grammar*
https://www.routledge.com/An-Introduction-to-Functional-Grammar/Halliday-Matthiessen/p/book/9781138324284

> “Paratactic relations rely on logical inference from juxtaposition…”

---

### examples

#### example 2a — constructed (sequenced causality)

**chinese**
\`\`\`
系统更新了，接口不兼容。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> the system was updated; the interface is incompatible.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> because the system was updated, the interface is no longer compatible.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese: causality inferred from order
- english: causality encoded explicitly

---

#### example 2b — discourse-natural

**chinese**
\`\`\`
天气冷了，电费高了。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> it got cold; electricity bills went up.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> electricity bills went up because the weather got colder.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese compresses cause → effect
- english serializes cause → effect

---

#### example 2c — research-attested

> “Logical relations such as cause–effect are frequently conveyed in Chinese through linear ordering rather than overt conjunctions.”

**citation**
Tai, J. H.-Y. (1985). *Temporal sequence and Chinese word order*. John Benjamins.

**contrastive implication**
- chinese reasoning appears **non-stepwise**
- english reasoning appears **procedural**

---

## 3. abstraction density in written chinese

### claim
written chinese carries high semantic density and tolerates abstraction without scaffolding.

### source
DeFrancis, John — *The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy*
https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/the-chinese-language-fact-and-fantasy/

> “Chinese characters tend to represent morphemes with relatively broad semantic scope…”

---

### examples

#### example 3a — constructed (bare abstraction)

**chinese**
\`\`\`
结构失衡，系统脆弱。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> structural imbalance; system fragility.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> because the system’s structure is imbalanced, it becomes fragile.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese allows **noun-only abstraction**
- english expands into causal explanation

---

#### example 3b — academic prose

**chinese**
\`\`\`
条件、路径、结果之间的关系
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> the relationships between conditions, pathways, and outcomes.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> the ways in which different conditions influence pathways and ultimately determine outcomes.

**demonstrated difference**
- chinese tolerates unexpanded abstraction
- english elaborates semantic links

---

#### example 3c — research-attested

> “Written Chinese permits strings of abstract nouns that would require clausal expansion in English.”

**citation**
DeFrancis, J. (1984). *The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy*.

**contrastive implication**
abstraction appears **complete** in chinese but **unfinished** in english without elaboration.

---

## 4. why chinese reasoning appears “holistic”

### claim
holism is a presentation effect, not a difference in inference.

### source
Richard Nisbett — *The Geography of Thought*
https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Geography-of-Thought/Richard-E-Nisbett/9780743255356

---

### examples

#### example 4a — constructed (global judgment)

**chinese**
\`\`\`
整体来看，这样更合理。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> taken as a whole, this is more reasonable.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> when we consider all the factors together, this option makes more sense than the alternatives.

---

#### example 4b — evaluative discourse

**chinese**
\`\`\`
放在这个环境下，是自然的选择。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> placed in this environment, it’s a natural choice.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> given the current environment, choosing this option follows logically from the constraints.

---

#### example 4c — research-attested

> “East Asians are more likely to explain events with reference to contextual factors rather than discrete causal agents.”

**citation**
Nisbett, R. E., et al. (2001). *Culture and systems of thought*. *Psychological Review*.

**contrastive implication**
context-first narration reads as “holistic” compared to agent-first narration.

---

## 5. language as projection, not cognition

### claim
language shapes expression of thought, not the underlying reasoning mechanism.

### source
Steven Pinker — *The Language Instinct*
https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct

---

### examples

#### example 5a — same reasoning, two projections

**chinese**
\`\`\`
条件不成立，方案失败。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> the condition does not hold; the plan fails.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> because the required condition wasn’t met, the plan ended up failing.

---

#### example 5b — bilingual reporting

**chinese expression**
short judgment, minimal narration

**english expression**
expanded explanation, explicit reasoning

**demonstrated difference**
projection varies; inference does not.

---

#### example 5c — research-attested

> “Thought can exist independently of the particular language in which it is expressed.”

**citation**
Pinker, S. (1994). *The Language Instinct*.

## 6. why llms exaggerate linguistic affordances

### claim
llms optimize for language-specific fluency and amplify stylistic norms.

### source
Bender et al. (2021) — “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots”
https://aclanthology.org/2021.faccctutorials.1/

---

### examples

#### example 6a — same prompt, different projections

**chinese output (typical)**
short, abstract, implicit

**english output (typical)**
longer, explicit, stepwise

**demonstrated difference**
llms lean into each language’s affordances.

---

#### example 6b — observed behavior

- chinese: omits premises, agents, connectors
- english: overproduces them

---

#### example 6c — research-attested

> “The models’ outputs reflect the statistical properties and conventions of their training data.”

**citation**
Bender, E. M., et al. (2021). ACL.

---

## 7. reasoning graph vs narration graph

### claim
step count and explicit premises are unreliable indicators of reasoning depth.

### source
Daniel Kahneman — *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557/thinkingfastandslow

---

### examples

#### example 7a — minimal judgment

**chinese**
\`\`\`
不行。
\`\`\`

**literal translation**
> that won’t work.

**natural translation (contrast)**
> that won’t work, because it violates the constraints we discussed earlier.

---

#### example 7b — expert discourse

**chinese experts**
often state conclusion only

**english experts**
often preemptively justify

---

#### example 7c — research-attested

> “People often cannot articulate the processes by which they reached a judgment, even when the judgment is correct.”

**citation**
Kahneman, D. (2011). *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.

---

## final compressed takeaway

> chinese and english don’t encode different reasoning — they encode **different expectations about what must be said aloud**.

what differs is:
- what must be externalized
- what may remain implicit

the **reasoning graph stays the same**;
the **narration graph bends to language**.
