## instructions

surface knowledge gaps across the research:
- explicit omissions (questions asked but not answered)
- implicit omissions (questions that should have been asked)
- symmetric omissions (patterns from parallel domains not yet explored)
- contradictions (kernels in conflict with each other)
- sparse clusters (domains with few kernels relative to others)
