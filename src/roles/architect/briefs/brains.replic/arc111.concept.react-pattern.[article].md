# react-pattern

## .what

a prompting paradigm that interleaves reasoning traces with actions, producing explicit Thought → Action → Observation cycles that ground reasoning in real-world feedback.

## .why

react addresses a fundamental limitation of pure reasoning: hallucination. by forcing the model to take actions and observe actual results between reasoning steps, react grounds abstract thought in concrete feedback. this synergy of reasoning and acting enables more reliable task completion.

## dependsOn

- `reasoning-trace` — the "thought" component
- `tool-call` — the "action" component
- `tool-result` — the "observation" component
- `agentic-loop` — orchestrates the cycle

## pattern structure

```
Thought: I need to find information about X
Action: Search("X")
Observation: [search results]
Thought: Based on these results, I should check Y
Action: Read("file_y.txt")
Observation: [file contents]
Thought: Now I can answer the question
Answer: ...
```

## benchmark performance

| benchmark | react vs baseline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| HotPotQA | competitive with CoT, lower hallucination (6% vs 14%) |
| ALFWorld | +34% over imitation learning |
| WebShop | significantly outperforms Act-only |

## tradeoffs

### strengths
- grounded in real observations
- lower hallucination rate
- interpretable decision process
- recovers from errors via feedback

### weaknesses
- structurally constrained (forced action after each thought)
- dependent on quality of retrieved information
- may force unnecessary actions

## comparison with pure CoT

| aspect | CoT | ReAct |
|--------|-----|-------|
| grounding | internal only | external observations |
| hallucination | higher | lower |
| flexibility | high | constrained by structure |
| task types | reasoning | reasoning + interaction |
