# research: claims for init.research

## claims from web research

### systematic research methodology

**[FACT]** systematic reviews use structured methods to identify, analyze, and collate scientific literature, and when conducted methodically, are considered the highest tier in research studies [1]

> "Systematic reviews use structured methods to identify, analyze, and collate scientific literature, and when conducted methodically, are considered the highest tier in research studies, providing focused and unbiased analysis with explicit methods of identification and analysis."

**[FACT]** research follows a structured process: define problem, review literature, design study, collect data, analyze results, draw conclusions [1]

> "Research follows a structured process, including defining a problem, reviewing literature, designing a study, collecting data, analyzing results, and drawing conclusions, with each step carefully planned and executed to ensure consistency and reliability."

### divergent thinking and parallel inquiry

**[FACT]** divergent thinking involves retrieval of knowledge and association of unrelated concepts in novel ways [2]

> "Divergent thinking can be described as a process of retrieving prior knowledge and associating and combining unrelated knowledge in a novel and meaningful way."

**[FACT]** strategies for divergent thinking include analogies, association, and metaphors [2]

> "Strategies for divergent thinking include analogies, association, and metaphors."

**[FACT]** design-by-analogy promotes divergent thinking by study of solutions from similar problems in other domains [2]

> "Design-by-analogy promotes divergent thinking by studying solutions that have solved similar problems and using this knowledge to make inferences and solve problems in new and unfamiliar situations."

**[FACT]** research involves iterative cycles of divergent (idea generation) and convergent (idea testing/selection) phases [3]

> "Research processes involve iterative and interacting cycles of divergent (generation of ideas) and convergent (testing and selecting of ideas) thinking processes."

**[OPIN]** creativity is greatest when relationship distance between collaborators is intermediate [3]

> "Creativity has been found to be greatest when the relationship distance between collaborators is intermediate—neither too close nor too far."

### cross-domain knowledge synthesis

**[FACT]** intersection interpretation integrates disparate knowledge into coherent framework (convergent), while cross-inspiration fosters free exploration (divergent) [4]

> "Intersection interpretation integrates disparate knowledge into a coherent framework by detailing the logical relationships and interactions between different disciplines, thereby representing convergent thinking, while cross-inspiration fosters free exploration and creativity based on prior knowledge, thereby representing divergent thinking."

**[FACT]** simultaneous access to deep and broad knowledge enhances convergent thinking [4]

> "Simultaneous access to deep and broad knowledge enhances convergent thinking, while intersection interpretations foster divergent thinking."

---

### knowledge gap identification

**[FACT]** a research gap is a topic where absent or inadequate information limits ability to reach conclusions [5]

> "A research gap is defined as a topic or area for which absent or inadequate information limits the ability of reviewers to reach a conclusion for a given question."

**[FACT]** gap identification requires two elements: characterization of gaps and classification of reasons for gaps [5]

> "A comprehensive framework includes two elements: (1) the characterization of the gaps and (2) the identification and classification of the reason(s) for the research gap."

**[FACT]** reasons for gaps categorize as: insufficient info, biased info, inconsistent results, or wrong info [5]

> "The PICOS framework... categorizes the reasons for gaps as: (A) insufficient or imprecise information, (B) biased information, (C) inconsistent or unknown consistency results, and/or (D) not the right information."

**[SUMP]** a research gap is not created by search alone; it requires thorough read and comprehension [5]

> "A research gap is not created by simply searching databases for relevant material; instead, a research gap is created when the literature is thoroughly read and understood."

---

### knowledge management best practices

**[FACT]** knowledge capture uses structured methods: interviews, documentation, multimedia recordings [6]

> "Knowledge capture processes leverage structured methods such as interviews, documentation, and multimedia recordings, including exit interviews, knowledge transfer sessions, after-action reviews, expert interviews, and video/audio recordings of demonstrations."

**[FACT]** centralized repositories serve as single source of truth with structured, searchable format [6]

> "A centralized knowledge repository serves as the single source of truth for vital information, with information stored in a structured, searchable format, ensuring easy accessibility for authorized users."

**[KHUE]** how should AI-driven knowledge management integrate with human-led research processes?

## claims from wish and vision

**[SUMP]** 21+ probes enforces sufficient breadth of inquiry [7]

> from vision: "probes.aim enforces breadth (21+ questions, divergent paths)"

**[KHUE]** is 21 the right threshold, or should it vary by domain complexity? [7]

> from vision awkward bits: "21 probes is arbitrary — might need tune per domain complexity"

**[SUMP]** parallel agents can fan out to investigate probes concurrently [7]

> from vision: "parallel agents fan out, each to investigate a probe"

**[KHUE]** how do we ensure no duplicate probes across parallel agents? [7]

> from vision awkward bits: "parallel agents coordination — how do we ensure no duplicate probes?"

**[OPIN]** absorb is the hardest phase due to synthesis across diverse probes [7]

> from vision awkward bits: "absorb is the hardest phase — synthesis across diverse probes is cognitively intense"
