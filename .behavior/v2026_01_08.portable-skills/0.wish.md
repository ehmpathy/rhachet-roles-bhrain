look at the diffs in https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhuild/pull/27/files

(if you cant read those diffs, halt and tell the human. this is a core requirement.)

---

replicate the changes made in those diffs onto this repo

this way
1. we're consistent across repos, for easier maintenance
2. we leverage the lessons learned there for how to make skills more portable
