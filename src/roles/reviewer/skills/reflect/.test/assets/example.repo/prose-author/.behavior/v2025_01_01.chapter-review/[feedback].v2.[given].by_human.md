# feedback on introduction section

## context

reviewing the introduction to the technical writing handbook

## observations

### clarity over cleverness

found several instances of clever wordplay that obscures meaning:

```
The synergistic paradigm shifts in our ideation matrix...
```

prefer plain language:

```
Our approach to generating ideas has changed...
```

### one idea per paragraph

paragraphs contain multiple unrelated ideas. each paragraph should have one main point supported by evidence.

### avoid jargon

technical terms without explanation alienate readers:

```
The API leverages RESTful endpoints with OAuth2 authentication.
```

prefer contextual explanation:

```
The system communicates through a web interface (API) that uses
industry-standard security practices for user verification.
```

## summary

prioritize clarity and accessibility in technical prose.
