│  │  I dug into the actual production code (not just the blueprint prose) and cross-checked against the peer reviews already on disk for this stone. Two things up front:
│  │  
│  │  **The stone is currently blocked** (`.route/passage.jsonl`: `3.3.1.blueprint.product` → `blocked`, `blockers exceed threshold (5 > 0)`), and one of the i2 peer reviewers (`r11.enroll-blueprint-arch-defects`) already surfaced the most serious gap below in more detail than I initially found — I verified its claims directly against the code and they hold up. Ironically, `r11`'s own raw review output ends in `💥 malfunction: reviewer output lacks a numeric blocker/nitpick count` (it wrote `🔴`/`🟠`/`🟡` headers, no `N blockers` line) — it's a live instance of exactly the bug this wish fixes.
│  │  
│  │  ## 1. [confirmed, unresolved] the observability marker's plumbing is undercounted
│  │  
│  │  The blueprint's filediff tree and "data flow" diagram treat `formatGuardTree.ts` as the one hop that sources `tactic`. I traced the actual call chain and it's **3 files, not 1**, two of which aren't in the filediff tree at all:
│  │  
│  │  - `RouteStoneGuardReviewArtifact` (artifact, gains `+tactic`)
│  │  - → `setStoneAsPassed.ts:805-817` (`computeGuardData`'s `reviews.map(...)` — hand-builds `{ blockers: r.blockers, nitpicks: r.nitpicks, ... }`; needs `tactic: r.tactic` added) — **listed in the filediff tree, but only for context-widening; this second edit goes unmentioned**
│  │  - → `formatRouteStoneEmit.ts:118-146` — **absent from the filediff tree entirely**, yet it's the actual prod caller of `formatGuardTree` (only call site: `formatRouteStoneEmit.ts:205`) and independently redeclares the identical `guard.reviews: Array<{...}>` shape
│  │  - → `formatGuardTree.ts` — three separate touch points internally (the `Pick<...>` type at `:40-43`, the inline `input.guard.reviews` type at `:276-292`, and the `reviewInputs.map` at `:466-478`), only the last (`asReviewerTreeStateFromMeter`, `:226`) is named "critical" in the blueprint
│  │  
│  │  Miss any one hop and the `tallied by reviewer@$brain` marker — the single most emphasized, wisher-confirmed requirement in the whole vision — silently never reaches stdout, while `formatGuardReviewerTree.test.ts` (built against a hand-constructed `ReviewerTreeState`) still passes green. The repo already has named rules for this exact smell (`rule.forbid.duplicate-format-tree-operations`, `rule.require.single-source-of-truth-for-render`) — the "review display record" shape is independently declared 3 times with 2 manual field-mapping sites.
│  │  
│  │  **Whether an acceptance test would catch it**: the journey acceptance test (`driver.route.peer-measurement.journey.acceptance.test.ts`) should catch this *if* it drives through the real CLI → `formatRouteStoneEmit` render path (per `rule.require.acceptance.blackbox`), but the blueprint never says so explicitly — it's an assumption riding on the "acceptance tests must be blackbox" convention rather than a stated guarantee.
│  │  
│  │  ## 2. [confirmed, unresolved] eager brain construction breaks the "zero cost for conforming reviewers" promise
│  │  
│  │  Also flagged by r11 and independently plausible from the codepath tree: `route.ts` builds the brain via `genContextBrain({ choice: FIXED_FALLBACK_BRAIN })` **unconditionally on every `route.stone.set --as passed`**, before any reviewer is known to need the fallback, then threads it through 4 otherwise brain-agnostic hops. If brain-choice resolution isn't lazy (r11 claims it resolves synchronously at construction), a brain-package problem breaks 100% of stone-passing operations — directly contradicting blackbox usecase.1 ("no extra brain cost is incurred") and the vision's own cost table. This repo just had a brain-package removal incident (`ef68d79`), so this isn't hypothetical. **No test in the coverage plan exercises "brain package broken/absent + reviewer is fully conforming" — that boundary is unaddressed.**
│  │  
│  │  ## 3. [new] persisted footer string doubles as parse contract, with no test locking it
│  │  
│  │  The cache-survival design recovers `tactic` on reconstruction by regex-matching the literal string `tallied by reviewer@…` in the persisted artifact footer — the same string the human-facing render emits. Nothing decouples display copy from parse contract; a future copy tweak breaks cache-reconstruction silently, with no failing test pointing at the cause. The test-coverage plan has no case for "cache-hit after a footer-copy change" or asserting the two are sourced from one shared constant.
│  │  
│  │  ## 4. [new] evidence-gate strictness — flagged as open, but no boundary test locks the risky edge
│  │  
│  │  The blueprint's own mitigation #3 (empty `evidence` → `detected:false`) trades a hallucination risk for a new false-negative risk: an over-strict gate could reject a genuine terse "lgtm, 0/0" review as `detected:false` → spurious malfunction — the exact failure mode this wish exists to eliminate, just moved one layer down. The blueprint admits this ("tune against boundary tests, do not over-reject genuine terse reviews") but matrix B / the `getReviewCountsViaBrain` test list has no explicit case distinguishing "terse-but-genuine clean pass" from "empty/garbage." This is a friction hazard named but not fenced by a test.
│  │  
│  │  ## 5. [new] malfunction-cause message distinction is designed but not asserted
│  │  
│  │  The vision explicitly asks that a human be able to tell "odd phrasing the brain also couldn't parse" apart from "genuinely empty review" apart from "brain infra failure." The blueprint's mitigation section promises distinct stderr messages for these, but the test-coverage section only asserts *that* a malfunction occurs, not that the messages are distinguishable. Worth a snapshot or explicit string assertion.
│  │  
│  │  ## 6. [new] "single source of truth" section is an unresolved dispute, not a resolved decision
│  │  
│  │  That section is a rebuttal to two peer-review blockers (`judge-derived-counts`, `review-standardization-at-parse`) from repo-rules review — it argues the design already satisfies the rules' intent, but ends with "if the rule is read literally... that's a separate refactor... flagged for the wisher rather than silently assumed." That's an open question dressed as a closed section — worth surfacing to the wisher explicitly before execution rather than left as blueprint prose.
│  │  
│  │  ## 7. [minor] naming drift + one asymmetric flag
│  │  
│  │  - Blueprint calls out the `exitCode`-in-orchestrator deviation for wisher visibility but doesn't give the `evidence` schema field (a real prompt/schema addition beyond the vision) the same treatment.
│  │  - Blueprint refers to `RouteStoneGuardReviewArtifact` for the `+tactic` field; that's the `@deprecated` alias — the live type is `RouteStoneGuardReviewPeerArtifact`.
│  │  - Test-file convention divergence: existing brain tests split boundary cases into separate files (`stepReview.caseBrain.deepseek-v4-flash.case1/2/3.integration.test.ts`); the blueprint bundles all of `getReviewCountsViaBrain`'s ~5 boundary rows into one file — inconsistent with precedent, worth reconciling.
│  │  
│  │  ## bottom line
│  │  
│  │  The blueprint's core design (grain split, discriminated union, cascade) is sound, but it isn't ready to execute against as written — item 1 and 2 are verified, non-hypothetical gaps (one already blocking the stone via peer review) that would let the fix ship without its headline observability guarantee or its headline cost guarantee actually holding. I'd fix 1–3 in the blueprint text, add explicit test rows for 4–5, and get an explicit wisher answer on 6 before moving to execution.
