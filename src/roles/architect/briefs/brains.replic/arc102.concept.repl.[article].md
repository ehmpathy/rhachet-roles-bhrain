# repl (read-eval-print-loop)

## .what

an interactive programming pattern where the system reads user input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops back to read more input.

## .why

the repl pattern enables iterative, conversational interaction. when an llm operates behind a repl, it can receive feedback, execute actions, observe results, and refine its approach — the foundation of agentic behavior.

## dependsOn

- (none — foundational primitive)

## key characteristics

- **read**: accept input from user or environment
- **eval**: process and execute the input
- **print**: display results or output
- **loop**: repeat the cycle indefinitely

## in replic brains

the repl structure manifests as:
1. **read**: receive user message or tool result
2. **eval**: llm generates response/action
3. **print**: emit response or execute tool
4. **loop**: continue until task complete
