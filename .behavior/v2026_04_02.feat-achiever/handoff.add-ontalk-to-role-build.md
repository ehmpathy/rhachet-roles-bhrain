# handoff: add onTalk to rhachet Role.build

## what

rhachet's `Role.build()` needs to support `onTalk` hook that maps to Claude's `UserPromptSubmit` event.

## why

the achiever role needs to accumulate asks as they arrive (onTalk), but Role.build only supports:
- `onBoot` → SessionStart
- `onTool` → PreToolUse
- `onStop` → Stop

without `onTalk`, the achiever role has to use an init workaround that directly modifies `.claude/settings.json`.

## current workaround

```
src/domain.roles/achiever/
├── inits/
│   ├── init.claude.hooks.sh          # adds UserPromptSubmit hook to settings.json
│   └── claude.hooks/
│       └── userpromptsubmit.ontalk.sh  # the actual hook command
```

the init uses `jq` to inject the hook into settings.json. this works but:
- bypasses rhachet's hook abstraction
- requires manual `rhachet roles init --role achiever`
- doesn't get cleaned up on role unlink

## desired state

```typescript
// src/domain.roles/achiever/getAchieverRole.ts
export const ROLE_ACHIEVER: Role = Role.build({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    onBrain: {
      onStop: [{ command: '...', timeout: 'PT10S' }],
      onTalk: [{ command: '...', timeout: 'PT5S' }],  // <-- this should work
    },
  },
});
```

rhachet should:
1. accept `onTalk` in the hooks schema
2. map `onTalk` to `UserPromptSubmit` in settings.json generation
3. handle cleanup on role unlink

## where to implement

rhachet repo — the hook mapping logic that generates settings.json from Role definitions.

## acceptance criteria

- [ ] `onTalk` accepted in Role.build hooks schema
- [ ] `onTalk` maps to `UserPromptSubmit` in generated settings
- [ ] achiever role declares onTalk in getAchieverRole.ts
- [ ] asks are accumulated without init workaround
- [ ] role unlink removes the hook
