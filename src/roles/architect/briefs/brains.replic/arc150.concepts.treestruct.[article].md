# concepts treestruct

## .what

a hierarchical visualization of replic brain concepts showing dependency relationships — foundational concepts at roots, composed concepts as branches.

## .why

understanding how concepts compose reveals the architecture of replic brains. this treestruct shows which concepts are foundational (independent), which depend on others, and how they combine to form complete agent systems.

## layer analysis

### foundational (no dependencies)
- `llm` — the reasoning engine
- `repl` — the interaction pattern

### core infrastructure
- `context-window` — working memory
- `system-prompt` — behavior configuration
- `tool-definition` — capability schemas

### execution layer
- `agentic-loop` — the orchestration pattern
- `tool-call` / `tool-result` — action interface
- `message` / `session` — conversation structure

### reasoning strategies
- `reasoning-trace` — intermediate steps
- `react-pattern` — grounded reasoning
- `reflexion-pattern` — self-improvement
- `tree-of-thoughts` — deliberate search
- `self-consistency` — ensemble reasoning
- `lats-pattern` — learned search
- `plan-and-solve` — explicit planning
- `extended-thinking` — compute scaling

### extensions
- `context-compaction` — memory management
- `subagent` — parallel/isolated execution
- `mcp` — tool standardization

## architectural insight

the treestruct reveals that replic brains are built from:

1. **two primitives**: llm + repl
2. **three constraints**: context-window, system-prompt, tool interface
3. **one core loop**: agentic-loop
4. **many reasoning strategies**: interchangeable approaches to improve quality
5. **extension mechanisms**: compaction, subagents, protocols

different replic brains make different choices within this framework, but all share the same foundational structure.
