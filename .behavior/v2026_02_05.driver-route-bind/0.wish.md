wish =

we want to be able to `route.bind` a route to a branch

probably, persist that state in `.route/`

so that we can call `route.bind .behavior/xyz` once

and then no longer need to prescribe the --route on every `route.stone.get|set|del` operation after that

e.g., 

route.stone.get --stone becomes sufficient

because --route gets lookedup from `.route/bind`


checkout how rhachet-roles-bhuild binds their behaviors to branches here: https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhuild/blob/main/src/domain.roles/behaver/skills/bind.behavior.sh

walk that chain to see file format and other ideas

we want to be symmetric
