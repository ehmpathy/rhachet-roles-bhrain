read the probe questions collected in $RESEARCH_DIR_REL/1.3.probes.aim.blend.v1.i1.md

for each question, launch a parallel subagent to investigate:
- one probe subagent per one question
- recommended brain: sonnet or higher

---

## subagent instructions

each probe subagent must do a thorough investigation:
- websearch to find atleast 11 relevant sources per question
- for each source, do a deep dive:
  - full summary of the source
  - MANY direct quotes (not just one or two)
  - conclusion with takeaway relationship to the wish
- distinguish facts from opinions
- note gaps and uncertainties

this is not a shallow citation list — each probe must thoroughly investigate each citation.

each subagent emits to: $RESEARCH_DIR_REL/probe.v1/q$N.probe.research.response.v1.i1.md
- where $N is the question number assigned to that probe

---

## orchestration

emit an inventory of the dispatched probes into:
$RESEARCH_DIR_REL/2.probe.emit.v1.i1.inventory.md

as each subagent completes, update its progress & stats in the inventory file
