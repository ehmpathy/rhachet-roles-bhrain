# research: domain terms for route.drive

## overview

this document researches terminology for the domain objects required to fulfill the route.drive wish, vision, and criteria. the goal is to establish a ubiquitous language that maximizes specificity and intuition.

---

## domain objects identified

from the wish and vision, the following domain objects are needed:

| object | purpose | type |
|--------|---------|------|
| route | the behavior path with ordered stones | entity |
| stone | a waypoint/checkpoint within a route | entity |
| review.self | a self-check guard configuration | literal |
| promise | the record of a self-review attestation | event |
| guard | the quality gate mechanism | literal |

## parallel domain research

### 1. aviation: preflight checklists

> "a preflight checklist is a list of tasks that should be performed by pilots and aircrew prior to takeoff, and its purpose is to improve flight safety by ensuring that no important tasks are forgotten." [1]

> "the faa's practical test standards clearly state that pilots must use appropriate written checklists." [1]

key terms:
- **checklist** — ordered list of verification items
- **preflight** — before the main action begins
- **clearance** — authorization to proceed

**relevant insight**: aviation uses mandatory checklists with explicit sign-off. pilots don't self-assess; they verify against a prescribed list.

### 2. gps navigation: waypoints

> "a waypoint is a point or place on a route or line of travel, a stopping point, an intermediate point, or point at which course is changed." [2]

> "in gps navigation, a 'route' is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints." [2]

> "a checkpoint is a point at which a traveler or vehicle is stopped for personal identification, vehicle inspection, etc." [2]

key terms:
- **waypoint** — a point along a route
- **route** — series of waypoints
- **checkpoint** — verification point

**relevant insight**: "stone" is more evocative than "waypoint" — stones are solid, permanent, markers you can touch. waypoints feel digital and ephemeral.

### 3. hiking: cairns and trail markers

> "cairns are intentionally constructed stacks of rocks that mark trails and guide hikers in the mountains above treeline, and in other barren areas. the word is scottish, and simply means 'a pile of rocks.'" [3]

> "humans have been using cairns as trail markers for thousands of years, with people traversing across barren landscapes realizing they could stack rocks to indicate the correct route." [3]

> "the three basic trail makers are: blazes, cairns, and ducks." [3]

key terms:
- **cairn** — stacked stones as trail marker
- **blaze** — painted mark on trees
- **trail marker** — any guidance signal

**relevant insight**: "stone" aligns beautifully with "cairn" — both are ancient, physical, permanent markers. a route marked by stones is deeply intuitive across cultures.

### 4. surgery: time-out and pause

> "a time-out is the surgical team's short pause, just before incision, to confirm that they are about to perform the correct procedure on the correct body part of the correct patient." [4]

> "the who guidelines for safe surgery defines a 'time out' or 'surgical pause' as a brief, less than one minute pause in operating-room activity immediately before incision, at which time all members of the operating team verbally confirm the identity of the patient, the operative site and the procedure to be performed." [4]

> "for the time-out to be performed properly, every member of the surgical team should participate and guarantee the correct patient, procedure, and site." [4]

key terms:
- **time-out** — mandatory pause for verification
- **pause** — stopping to confirm
- **sign-in / sign-out** — entry and exit verification

**relevant insight**: surgery uses structured pauses where each participant must verbally confirm. this parallels the review.self flow — forcing the clone to pause and affirm before proceeding.

### 5. legal: oaths and attestations

> "an oath is an outward pledge given by the person taking it that his attestation or promise is made under an immediate sense of his responsibility to god." [5]

> "an affirmation is a solemn and formal declaration or asseveration in the nature of an oath that a statement, or series of statements, is true." [5]

> "attestation is a kind of testimony or confirmation. it is customary to sign a deed, make a will or sign other written documents in the presence of a witness who also signs the document to attest to its contents." [6]

key terms:
- **oath** — solemn promise with spiritual weight
- **affirmation** — secular equivalent of oath
- **attestation** — formal confirmation/testimony
- **pledge** — commitment to action
- **vow** — promise with binding intent

**relevant insight**: "promise" is lighter than "oath" but carries personal commitment. "attestation" is formal but corporate-sounding. "pledge" implies future action. "vow" implies permanence.

### 6. railroad: block signaling

> "signalling block systems enable the safe and efficient operation of railways by preventing collisions between trains. the basic principle is that a track is broken up into a series of sections or 'blocks'. only one train may occupy a block at a time." [7]

> "in railroading, to dispatch means to give a conductor orders for when, how far and how fast a train can travel. blocks are segments of track, not unlike a block on a city street." [7]

> "green indicates clear, the train can proceed. yellow indicates approach, but at a restricted speed. red indicates stop, the block is currently occupied." [7]

key terms:
- **block** — segment of track
- **clearance** — authorization to proceed
- **dispatch** — issue orders for movement

**relevant insight**: railroad blocks are sequential gates. a train cannot enter the next block until the prior is clear. this parallels how stones must be passed sequentially.

### 7. software: stage-gate process

> "a phase-gate process is a project management technique in which an initiative or project is divided into distinct stages or phases, separated by decision points (known as gates)." [8]

> "at each gate, continuation is decided by (typically) a manager, steering committee, or governance board, based on forecasts and information available at the time." [8]

> "quality gates act as checkpoints throughout software development, ensuring each stage meets specific criteria before code advances to the next phase." [8]

key terms:
- **stage** — a phase of work
- **gate** — decision point between stages
- **quality gate** — verification checkpoint

**relevant insight**: "guard" aligns well with "gate" — both imply something that must be passed through. guards are more active (they check), gates are more passive (they block).

## term analysis by domain object

### 1. route

**current term**: `route`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| gps | route | series of waypoints |
| hiking | trail | marked path |
| railroad | line | track between points |
| aviation | flight plan | prescribed path |

**recommendation**: keep **route**
- universally understood
- implies direction and purpose
- pairs naturally with "drive"

### 2. stone

**current term**: `stone`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| gps | waypoint | intermediate point |
| hiking | cairn | stone marker |
| software | milestone | significant checkpoint |
| railroad | block | track segment |
| aviation | checkpoint | verification point |

**recommendation**: keep **stone**
- "cairn" is scottish for "pile of rocks" — stone captures this essence
- more evocative than "waypoint" or "milestone"
- physical, permanent, tangible metaphor
- pairs beautifully with "route" (a route marked by stones)

### 3. review.self

**current term**: `review.self`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| surgery | time-out | pause to verify |
| aviation | checklist | verification list |
| legal | self-attestation | personal confirmation |
| software | quality gate | checkpoint |

**options**:
| option | pros | cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `review.self` | clear subject (self), clear action (review) | two words, dot notation |
| `guard.self` | aligns with extant guard concept | "guard" is the mechanism, not the act |
| `check.self` | simple, clear | "check" is overloaded |
| `attest.self` | formal, legal weight | unfamiliar term |
| `pause` | surgery-inspired, evocative | doesn't imply review |

**recommendation**: keep **review.self**
- explicit: the self is doing the review
- pairs with `review.peer` (extant concept)
- clear hierarchy: `guard.review.self` and `guard.review.peer`

### 4. promise

**current term**: `promise` (via `--as promised`)

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| legal | oath | solemn pledge |
| legal | affirmation | secular oath |
| legal | attestation | formal confirmation |
| legal | pledge | commitment |
| legal | vow | binding promise |
| surgery | confirm | verbal verification |
| software | sign-off | formal approval |

**options**:
| option | command form | pros | cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| `promise` | `--as promised --that $slug` | personal, binding | casual for some contexts |
| `attest` | `--as attested --that $slug` | formal, legal weight | unfamiliar, corporate |
| `affirm` | `--as affirmed --that $slug` | clear, secular | less personal |
| `pledge` | `--as pledged --that $slug` | commitment-focused | implies future |
| `vow` | `--as vowed --that $slug` | strong, permanent | too heavy |
| `confirm` | `--as confirmed --that $slug` | simple | too weak |
| `swear` | `--as sworn --that $slug` | strong | too religious |

**recommendation**: keep **promise**
- balanced weight — serious but not oppressive
- personal accountability
- javascript developers already understand promises (familiar term)
- "i promise" is natural speech

### 5. guard

**current term**: `guard`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| software | gate | decision point |
| software | check | verification |
| railroad | signal | permission indicator |
| aviation | clearance | authorization |

**recommendation**: keep **guard**
- already established in codebase
- active agent (guards check, gates just block)
- `guard.review.self` and `guard.review.peer` are clear

### 6. slug (review identifier)

**current term**: `slug`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| web | slug | url-safe identifier |
| legal | item | checklist entry |
| aviation | line item | checklist line |

**recommendation**: keep **slug**
- web-familiar term
- url-safe, concise identifier
- already used throughout codebase

### 7. say (review content)

**current term**: `say`

**parallel terms**:
| domain | term | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| surgery | prompt | what to verify |
| aviation | instruction | what to do |
| legal | statement | what to affirm |

**options**:
| option | yaml example | pros | cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| `say` | `say: "did you..."` | simple, conversational | informal |
| `prompt` | `prompt: "did you..."` | technical, ai-familiar | too programmatic |
| `guide` | `guide: "did you..."` | helpful, advisory | vague |
| `ask` | `ask: "did you..."` | clear action | implies two-way |

**recommendation**: keep **say**
- simple, conversational
- natural: "the guard says..."
- pairs with echo semantics (we echo what it says)

| **slug** | the unique identifier for a review.self entry | "promise the 'all-done' slug" |
| **say** | the guide content echoed for a review.self | "see what the guard says" |
| **promise** | the attestation that a self-review was completed | "promise you checked everything" |
| **pass** | to complete a stone (after all reviews) | "mark the stone as passed" |
| **drive** | to remind the clone of current stone on stop | "route.drive fires on session end" |

## final recommendations

| object | keep current | rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| route | ✓ | universal, pairs with "drive" |
| stone | ✓ | evocative, physical, ancient |
| guard | ✓ | active agent, established |
| review.self | ✓ | explicit hierarchy |
| review.peer | ✓ | extant, consistent |
| slug | ✓ | web-familiar identifier |
| say | ✓ | simple, conversational |
| promise | ✓ | personal, balanced weight |
| pass | ✓ | clear outcome state |
| drive | ✓ | gps metaphor, active |

**all current terms are well-chosen.** the vocabulary draws from ancient (hiking cairns, oaths) and modern (gps, stage-gates) domains, creating an intuitive language.
