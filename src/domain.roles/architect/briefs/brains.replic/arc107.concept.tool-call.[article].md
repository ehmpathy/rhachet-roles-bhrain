# tool-call

## .what

a structured request generated by an llm to invoke a specific tool with given parameters, representing the agent's decision to take an external action.

## .why

tool calls are the mechanism by which replic brains interact with the world beyond text generation. when the llm determines that a task requires external action — reading a file, executing code, searching the web — it emits a tool call. this is the bridge between reasoning and action.

## dependsOn

- `tool-definition` — provides the schema for valid calls
- `llm` — generates the tool call
- `agentic-loop` — processes and executes the call

## key characteristics

- **structured**: follows the schema defined in tool-definition
- **atomic**: one tool call = one action
- **declarative**: specifies what to do, not how
- **interruptible**: execution may require user approval

## example

```json
{
  "tool": "Read",
  "parameters": {
    "file_path": "/home/user/project/src/main.ts",
    "offset": 100,
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

## lifecycle

1. llm generates tool call in response
2. system extracts and validates parameters
3. permission check (if required)
4. tool executes
5. result returned to context as `tool-result`

## parallelism

some systems allow multiple tool calls in a single response:
- **independent calls**: can execute in parallel
- **dependent calls**: must execute sequentially
