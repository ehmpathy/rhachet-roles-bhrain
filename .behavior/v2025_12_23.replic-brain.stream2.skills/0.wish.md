wish =

built on the research and briefs of src/roles/architect/briefs/brains.replic

we wish to implement `brain=replic.bhrain.struct.v1` - which replicates the claude-code replic brain blueprint


to produce a brain structure which
   1. can leverage anthropic's claude apis directly to replicate the emergent behaviors of claude-code, as a proof of concept
   2. can leverage opensource llms like `qwen`, which can use that same exact structure, and produce similar behaviors (the only difference being the choice of llm under the hood)

   - this bhrain:struct.1 should be modeled _exactly_ on what we find the structure of claude-code to be under the hood
   - we should try and reach to as close to partity for MVP as possible here

a critical piece of this work will be the test framework within which we can test the atomic components of the structure && the overall integration

ideally, we'd continue to leverage the `rhachet` libraries capacity for constructing thought routes via typescript, to implement this structure && test it


---

why we want to do this?
1. to understand how our core dependency operates
   1. curiosity
   2. &&
   3. you only truely know that which you can build
2. to understand how we could replace the core dependency if we ever decide to
   1. hopefully not
   2. but derisks it



---

the tools available to it should be

- files
- git
- websearch


core questions =
- permission management
- tool use (related to permission management)


---

possible to reuse the patterns & toolinterfaces that claude-code pioneered?

i.e.,

.agent/permissions ?
.agent/hooks ?
