wish =

that the review skill leveraged the same exact pattern of invocation as rhachet-roles-bhuild's init.behavior skill does

why?

because right now it seems like there's some significant issues with how long it takes for the skill to bootup

e.g., maybe it depends on npm or tsx or something

doesn't matter

what matters is that rhachet-roles-bhuild has figured out how to eliminate all of that delay while still using ts under the hood

lets 

1. declare a brief on that pattern (so we can later generalize it up via a rhachet command)
2. upgrade the review command in this repo (and the other commands too, like reflect) to use that best practice


so that way our consumers have rapidly invoked skills
