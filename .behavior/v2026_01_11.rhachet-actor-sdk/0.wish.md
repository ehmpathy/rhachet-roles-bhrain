we implemented the rhachet actor sdk to power reflect and review skills

---

# why

the actor sdk helps simplify how to think about agents, actors, and their roles (skills & briefs)

it makes the distinction between fully probabilistic (fluid) skill, mixed (rigid) skills, and fully deterministic (solid) skills clear

and it makes it easy to compose
- brains
- roles

# deets

specifically, while we cant leverage `genActor` from rhachet directly yet

we can mock out what we'd like that interface to be

the most important thing for us to declare is that we want to be able to swap the brain that a skill uses at any time

in order to do that, we'll want to leverage `genContextBrain` from rhachet, in order to enable the registration and search of brain repls from providers

so, we'll want to import the BrainRepls and BrainAtoms published by
- `rhachet-brain-openai`
- `rhachet-brain-anthropic`
- `rhachet-brain-xai`

and we'll want to load them into that context via genContextBrain

then, we can pass through that context throughout our `review` and `reflect` skills, so that we can access any brain at any time

---

and specifically, for these skills, we want to support the ability to swap brains via input arg

so, we'll want to grab the `--brain` flag, if given, and find it from the brains loaded into that context

we can probably add our own `genContextBrainChoice` which is a context that says

```ts
{
  brain: {
    choice: BrainAtom | BrainRepl,
  }
}
```

so that we can simply access the `context.brain.choice` going forward. (note, it should spread and add the choice key to the brain context, since the brain context will already have info in it)


---

then, once the context.brain.choice is accessable via `(input, context: ContextBrainChoice)`, we can pass that through to `reflect` and `review`

and instead of them using their own implementations of brain calls

they can simply use

context.brain.choice.ask() & context.brain.choice.act()


----

we should default the brain choice to xai code-fast-1 , for max speed & min cost


---

note, there's a separate brain interface proposal in this repo, BrainArch1; ignore it for now. we'll refactor that in the future

for now, act like that hole dir doesn't exist

focus only on review & reflect
