given this definition of brains; src/roles/thinker/briefs/term=brain.atomic_vs_replic.md

we wish to

1. thoroughly udnerstand how the replic brain of `claude-code` works
   1. cite sources
   2. cite papers
   3. breakdown atomic fundamental concepts
   4. show the treestruct of how they build upon eachother
   5. output a blueprint of exactly how its built

2. declare that breakdown in src/roles/architect/briefs
   1. specifically, create a new role called architect (i.e., bhrain architect)
   2. i.e., `src/roles/architect/briefs/brains.replic`
   3. just like the other breifs in this repo are structure, specifically the `src/roles/thinker/briefs/` operate, in terms of campus course breifs of articles, demos, and catalogs
   4. this role's briefs should explain exactly how brains are constructed and architected
   5. thsi role should be expected to keep up with the latest research on brain architectures that lead to the best artificial brains. (today, llm based, like `brain=replic:anthropic:claude-code`)

3. declare a blueprint for how we can make a `brain=replic:bhrain:struct.1` brain structure which
   1. can leverage anthropic's claude apis directly to replicate the emergent behaviors of claude-code, as a proof of concept
   2. can leverage opensource llms like `qwen`, which can use that same exact structure, and produce similar behaviors (the only difference being the choice of llm under the hood)

   - this bhrain:struct.1 should be modeled _exactly_ on what we find the structure of claude-code to be under the hood
   - we should try and reach to as close to partity for MVP as possible here

a critical piece of this work will be the test framework within which we can test the atomic components of the structure && the overall integration

ideally, we'd continue to leverage the `rhachet` libraries capacity for constructing thought routes via typescript, to implement this structure && test it

why we want to do this?
1. to understand how our core dependency operates
   1. curiosity
   2. &&
   3. you only truely know that which you can build
2. to understand how we could replace the core dependency if we ever decide to
   1. hopefully not
   2. but derisks it
