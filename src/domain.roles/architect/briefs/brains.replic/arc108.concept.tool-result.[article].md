# tool-result

## .what

the output returned from executing a tool call, injected back into the llm's context as feedback for continued reasoning.

## .why

tool results close the feedback loop in agentic systems. they allow the llm to observe the consequences of its actions, verify success or failure, and adjust its approach. without tool results, the agent would be operating blind.

## dependsOn

- `tool-call` — produces the result
- `context-window` — result consumes context tokens

## key characteristics

- **structured or text**: depends on tool (json, stdout, file contents)
- **may be truncated**: large outputs compressed to fit context
- **includes metadata**: success/failure, error messages
- **grounds reasoning**: provides factual information

## example

```
Tool Result (Read):
     1→import { Component } from 'react';
     2→
     3→export class App extends Component {
     4→  render() {
     5→    return <div>Hello World</div>;
     6→  }
     7→}
```

## handling large results

| strategy | description |
|----------|-------------|
| truncation | cut output at N characters/lines |
| summarization | llm summarizes before adding to context |
| pagination | return chunks with offset/limit |
| streaming | process incrementally |

## error results

tool results may indicate failures:
- file not found
- permission denied
- timeout exceeded
- invalid parameters

the llm must interpret these and adapt its approach.
