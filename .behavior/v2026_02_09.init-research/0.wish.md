take a look at how `ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhuild` has created their `init.behavior` skill

we want to mirror that to create a new `init.research` skill, which conducts research 

it should use its own `.research/` dir, symmteric to the `.behavior/` dir that the init.behavior's use

it should have a thought route, just like init behaver does

---

specifically, use the rhachet-roles-bhuild branch of vlad/driver-bind for your template

use the gh api to access it 

---

we specifically also want to create this skill under our librarian role

i dont think it has any contents or implementation yet, so you'll need to make it

and we also specifically want to symlink at the thinker/briefs/knowledge from the librarian/briefs, in a portable way

---

these thought routes should guide the thinker through

1. what to include in search (e.g., 1.probes.aim)
  1. articulation of the various questions that we should ask (atleast 21) to help understand
  2. divergent paths of thought and parallel domains that we should try and research for symmetric concepts

2. the act of research (e.g., 2.probes.emit) 
	send off each probe via parallel agents
	have each agent write their results into the research dir as their own artifact

3. the act of comprehension (e.g., 3.probes.absorb)
	create a catalog of all the knowledge the probes gathered
		clustered into disjoint topics
		layered via depths of abstraction
		with explicit relationships and dependencies show

	create a treestruct of how the topics relate
		most abstract to least abstract leafes
		if branches connect, show [$ref(xyz)] if its already enumerated earlier

	create a distillation, that breaks out facts, assumptions, claims, questions, optinions
		- flags divergence in thought
		- flags convergenece in thought
		- flags omissions and gaps (explicit omissions, implicit omissiions, symmetric omissions)

	create a summary of what is known vs not known

4. the act of supplementation (e.g., 4.probes.remit) 
	emit probes to gather the supplemental information that was detected via omissions, gaps, and contradictions, to fill in the gaps

	emit an artifact on how it augments the comprehension

5. the act of externalization (e.g., 5.briefs.emit)
	5.1 create a plan for how the brief docs should be structured, per that thinker/briefs/knowledge structure
	
	5.2 produce that structure, under .research/{dir}/output.briefs/*


something like that. lets iterate on this, too
