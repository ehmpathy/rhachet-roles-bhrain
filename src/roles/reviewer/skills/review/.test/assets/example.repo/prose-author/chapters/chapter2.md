# chapter 2: the reef garden

the exploring of the coral garden was shelly's favorite part of any day.
the dancing of the anemones in the current never got old.

"the glowing of these corals is unreal," marco whispered. the shimmering of
the sunlight through the water made everything look magical.

shelly loved the swimming through the arches. the discovering of hidden caves
and the meeting of new fish friends filled her with joy.

a sea star waved from below. the greeting between creatures was always pure.
the belonging she felt here — the connecting with the reef — was everything.

"the living here is the dream," marco said. the drifting among the corals,
the breathing of the salty water, the being one with the ocean.

the glittering of a school of tangs caught their eyes. the moving together
in perfect harmony reminded them why they loved this place so much.
