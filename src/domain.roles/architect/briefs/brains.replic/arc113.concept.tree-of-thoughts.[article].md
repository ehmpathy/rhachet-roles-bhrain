# tree-of-thoughts

## .what

a deliberate problem-solving framework that explores multiple reasoning paths as a tree structure, using search algorithms (BFS/DFS) and evaluation to find optimal solutions.

## .why

tree of thoughts addresses the limitation of linear chain-of-thought: once a reasoning path is taken, there's no backtracking. by explicitly exploring multiple branches and evaluating intermediate states, ToT enables deliberate planning and can solve problems requiring lookahead that linear approaches cannot.

## dependsOn

- `reasoning-trace` — each node contains reasoning
- `llm` — generates and evaluates thoughts

## pattern structure

```
                    [Problem]
                       │
          ┌────────────┼────────────┐
          │            │            │
     [Thought A]  [Thought B]  [Thought C]
          │            │            │
       [eval: 0.8]  [eval: 0.3]  [eval: 0.9] ← best
          │                         │
     [Thought A1]              [Thought C1]
          │                         │
       [eval: 0.6]              [eval: 0.95] ← selected

## key components

| component | purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| thought decomposition | break problem into steps |
| thought generator | propose multiple candidates |
| state evaluator | score intermediate states |
| search algorithm | BFS, DFS, or beam search |

## benchmark performance

| benchmark | ToT vs CoT |
|-----------|------------|
| Game of 24 | 74% vs 4% |
| Creative Writing | improved coherence |
| Crosswords | significantly higher solve rate |

## search strategies

| strategy | characteristic |
|----------|----------------|
| BFS | explore all options at each depth |
| DFS | explore deeply first, backtrack |
| beam search | keep top-k candidates at each level |

## cost tradeoff

ToT requires significantly more LLM calls than linear approaches:
- multiple thought proposals per step
- evaluation calls for each candidate
- may explore many branches

## vs other patterns

| pattern | exploration | backtracking |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| CoT | linear | none |
| Self-Consistency | parallel paths, no interaction | none |
| ToT | tree structure | yes |
| LATS | tree + MCTS | yes, with learning |
