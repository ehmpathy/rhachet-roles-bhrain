todo: distill further the facts in domain of language vs thought

how do language structures impact thought routes?

impact what concepts are navigated to? vs how they are navigated to?

i.e., do different languages produce different thought routes from the same entrypoint?

if so,

then

- how often do they converge on the same destination?
  - how often was the rationale for navigation there the same? how does it differ?
  - when they diverge on destination, is it due to structural language navigation features? (when temperature - randomness - is omitted)
- are some languages better suited for some subdomains than others?

e.g., some for prose, some for code, etc

alternatively, would be great to keep in mind for search-via-consensus

we'll want to get stats on this via research. given llm brains are trained on different language corpi, this should be possible.


ideally, brains trained on different languages do produce different thought paths, so we can explore a broader set of divergent concepts from the same entrypoints
