# chapter 1: the morning swell

the sun rose over coral bay as shelly the sea turtle stretched her flippers.
today the waves looked perfect — clean barrels rolled in from the deep blue.

"yo, shelly!" called marco from the reef. "you see this swell? it's gonna be
epic, dude."

shelly paddled out past the break. the ocean felt warm and salty against her
shell. she loved these early sessions, before the dolphins showed up and
hogged all the good waves.

a perfect set approached. she positioned herself, felt the water lift her up,
and dropped into the wave. pure stoke. the barrel wrapped around her as she
glided through, fins tucked tight.

"that's what i'm talkin about!" marco hooted from the lineup.

shelly popped out the other side and smiled. another beautiful day in paradise.
